## **Overview**

The Eye Blinking Detection Software is designed to detect and track eye blinks using machine learning models. The models are developed with a focus in photo editing software, but can be integrated into various applications, such as driver monitoring systems, attention tracking, and VR capabilities.

## **Requirements**

- Python 3.7 or above
- CV2 library
- Dlib library
- NumPy library
- TensorFlow library
- Sklearn library
- Matplotlib library

## Dataset
We were not able to upload dataset on GitHub due to size limitation but you can download the dataset on the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/serenaraju/yawn-eye-dataset-new?resource=download 

## **Usage**

- Install the required libraries by running the command pip install livelossplot.
- Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed. If any library is missing, you can install it using pip install [library-name].
- Add the dataset to Google Drive --> MyDrive and give access
- Follow the instructions on the text cells to train, evaluate and test the models.
- View the blink detection results displayed on the screen or customize the output as needed.
