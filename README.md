**Overview**

The Eye Blinking Detection Software is designed to detect and track eye blinks using machine learning models. The models are developed with a focus in photo editing software, but can be integrated into various applications, such as driver monitoring systems, attention tracking, and VR capabilities.

**Requirements**

- Python 3.7 or above
- OpenCV library
- Dlib library
- NumPy library
- TensorFlow library
- skelearn library

**Usage**

- Install the required libraries by running the command pip install livelossplot.
- Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed. If any library is missing, you can install it using pip install [library-name].
- Follow the instructions on the command line or GUI to interact with the software.
- View the real-time eye blink detection results displayed on the screen or customize the output as needed.
